### About the app
The Timex is a store of watches for men, women, and kids. In this personal project for my resume, I faced some UI challenges. I took the UI of this project from demo images of a project on Behance, which were in desktop size. So, I had to design the smaller sizes myself and hopefully, they have turned out well.
